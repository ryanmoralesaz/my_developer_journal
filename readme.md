Today I recapped Tailwind CSS.  
I started a course on NextJS
13  
It's very interesting that they are changing over to the app folder from the pages folder.  
I reviewed my git knowledge and was able to create a dropbox repo to share my projects without transferring the node_modules and taking up dropbox space.
I was able to get my steelwheelgames email working and I found my current teaching certificate with my industrial and emerging certificate.  
Tomorrow I will continue my next js 13 course.  
I also reviewed my ssh keys and was able to add a key for my macbook pro to github.
